# Stroke Prediction Project

According to WHO (2020), stroke is the second leading cause of death and third leading cause of disability globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. It occurs due to an interruption of blood supply to the brain, preventing brain tissues from receiving oxygen and nutrients. This condition requires immediate medical treatment as it can reduce brain damage and prevent death. Potential stroke risks include hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, smoking and obesity.

In this project, the team will apply machine learning (ML) techniques to predict how likely an individual is to encounter a stroke based on certain health and lifestyle attributes in the chosen dataset. With this prediction, patients who have been predicted to have a high risk of suffering from stroke could be flagged and sent for further medical tests to verify if they are truly at high risk.

Key highlight & issues handled: 
1. Cross Validation 
2. Handling of imbalanced data
3. Overfitting Checks
4. Benefit Structure with Probability Threshold
5. Feature Importance
